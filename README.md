Examples of discrete synthesis using the TuLiP toolbox

## Steps to set up TuLiP to run the examples

Create and activate a virtual env
  
    virtualenv -p python2.7 ~/.venvs/tulip
    source ~/.venvs/tulip/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install tulip  
    pip install jupyter matplotlib cvxopt

Clone this repo, browse to it, and start notebook server
  
    git clone git@github.com:pettni/tulip-examples.git
    cd tulip-examples
    jupyter-notebook
